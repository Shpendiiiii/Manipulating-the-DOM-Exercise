# Manipulating the DOM Exercise

This is a JavaScript code that creates classes "Film", "filmList" and "Program". The "Film" class defines a film object with properties such as title, description, actors, rating, image, and runtime. The "filmList" class extends the "Film" class and creates an array of film objects. It has methods such as "add" to add a film object to the array, "printOut" to log the entire film array, "swabs" to log a specific film object from the array based on an index, and "isciPoPlayer" to find films by a certain actor name. The "Program" class has a "test" method that is currently commented out. At the end, the code creates an array "data" and a function "addData" to add a film object to the "data" array, and then creates a "Film" object using the values in the "data" array.

The data about the movies can be entered through the form down below, and all of that information will be appended to the DOM.
